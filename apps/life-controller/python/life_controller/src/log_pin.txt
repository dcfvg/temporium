comments : To add an arduino, put "arduino :" at the beginiing of the ligne, then his name(arduino_mega or arduino_lift) , then his port, separeted by ":"
comments : after an arduino, put the right funtion and the coresponding pin connected to it, separated by ":", if function is not connected, put "NULL" as a pin
comments : list all pin output in the pin_array_output that are connected to the last arduino declared 
comments : list arduino terminal "python -m serial.tools.list_ports"
